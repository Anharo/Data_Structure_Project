# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Project

## Introduction
This project contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science.

## Data Structures
### 1. Array
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Searching (Linear and Binary)
- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

### 2. Linked List
- Singly Linked List
    - Insertion (at beginning, at end, at specific position)
    - Deletion (from beginning, from end, from specific position)
    - Searching
    - Traversal
- Doubly Linked List
    - Insertion (at beginning, at end, at specific position)
    - Deletion (from beginning, from end, from specific position)
    - Searching
    - Traversal

### 3. Stack
- Push
- Pop
- Peek
- Check Empty
- Check Full

### 4. Queue
- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Peek
- Check Empty
- Check Full

### 5. Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Searching
- Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

## Algorithms
### 1. Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort

### 2. Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search


## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project.
3. Compile and run the desired source files based on the data structure or algorithm you want to use.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform operations or execute algorithms.
